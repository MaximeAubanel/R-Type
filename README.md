# R-Type

## Introduction

For the sad ignorants among you who may not know this best-selling video game, which accounts for countless lost hours of our childhood, here is a little introduction. As you now understand, you have to make your own version of R-Type.

The purpose of this project is to create a one-to-four player game, using a client/server architecture. This is important. It MUST be a client/server architecture. Peer-to-peer communication is not allowed.

## Technical Constraints

- Run on Windows & Linux
- Multi-threaded server
- SFML
- Boost or Qt on clientside
- No external libraries on the server

### How to play ?
